    - Added `MultipleActiveResultSets=True` to connection strings
    - Allows comment filtering to fetch object definitions while main reader is open
    - Fixed "The connection does not support MultipleActiveResultSets" errors

### Fixed
- **Critical: Metadata Dictionary Empty Bug** - Server and Database were "Unknown" in conversational mode
  - **Root Cause**: Two code paths for launching AI Review had inconsistent metadata population
    - Path 1: Main window right-click → `MainShell.AIIntegration.cs` → Metadata WAS populated ✅
    - Path 2: Dependency Analyzer toolbar → `MainShell.TabManagement.cs` → Metadata was NOT populated ❌
  - **Solution**: Added metadata dictionary to `OnAIReviewRequested()` in `MainShell.TabManagement.cs`
  - **Impact**: Generated SQL scripts now show correct server/database in headers
  - **Debug Output Added**: Logs metadata count and values for verification
  - **Files Modified**: `SODA_PLUS_MAIN/Views/MainShell.TabManagement.cs` (line ~325)
- **AIRequest Metadata Population** - Consistent initialization across all code paths
  - Both paths now create metadata with `["Server"]` and `["Database"]` keys
  - Environment variable correctly passed from `_currentEnvironment`
  - Connection string preserved from ObjectInfo
- **Prompt Type Enum Parsing** - Correct handling of "CanThisCodeBeSplit" string
  - Event handler uses exact enum name for reliable parsing
  - Fallback to Summary if parsing fails (defensive coding)
- **Trigger Type Detection Bug** - Triggers showing as "TABLE" in upstream dependencies
  - **Root Cause**: `sys.triggers.type_desc` was returning incorrect values
  - **Solution**: Hardcoded `'TRIGGER'` in SQL query instead of relying on `type_desc`
  - **Impact**: Triggers now correctly display as "TRIGGER" instead of "TABLE"
  - **Files Modified**: `FetchDependencies_ReferencedBy.sql` (Version 2.1)
- **Duplicate Trigger Noise** - Triggers appearing in BOTH upstream and downstream
  - **Root Cause 1**: Trigger-specific query wasn't filtering triggers ON the analyzed table
    - Fixed by adding `WHERE t.parent_id <> object_id(@RootFullName)` filter
  - **Root Cause 2**: DMV query (`sys.dm_sql_referencing_entities`) also returning self-referencing triggers
    - Fixed by adding LEFT JOIN to `sys.triggers` and excluding matches
  - **Impact**: Analyzing `product.Family` now shows triggers ONLY in downstream (not upstream)
  - **Example**: `trg_Family_UPDATE` appears once (in References) instead of twice
  - **Files Modified**: `FetchDependencies_ReferencedBy.sql` (Version 2.2)
- **MultipleActiveResultSets Error** - "The connection does not support MultipleActiveResultSets"
  - **Root Cause**: Connection created in MAIN project didn't have MARS enabled
  - **Solution**: Added `MultipleActiveResultSets=True` to `ObjectInfo.GetConnectionString()` in MAIN project
  - **Impact**: Comment filtering now works without nested reader errors
  - **Files Modified**: `SODA_PLUS_MAIN/Models/ObjectInfo.cs`

### Changed
- **AI Analysis Dropdown Menu** - Reorganized menu structure
  - Added separator after "📚 Best Practices" and "🔧 Refactoring"
  - Conversational AI entries visually separated from traditional analysis types
  - Menu order now: Code Review → Quick Wins → [separator] → Security/Performance/Best Practices/Refactoring → [separator] → Conversational AI
- **AIReviewControl Architecture** - Mode-based UI switching
  - Traditional mode: Shows tabs (Prompt, Response, Formatted View, Refactor)
  - Conversational mode: Shows ConversationView control exclusively
  - Custom prompt disabled in conversational mode (chat takes over)
  - Execute button triggers different workflows based on mode
- **Event Handler Naming** - Clear distinction between analysis types
  - Traditional: `AIReview_Summary_Click`, `AIReview_Security_Click`, etc.
  - Conversational: `AIReview_CanCodeBeSplit_Click`
  - Consistent pattern across all menu items
- **Debug Logging Enhanced** - Comprehensive metadata tracking
  - `[LaunchAIReview]` logs in MainShell.AIIntegration.cs
  - `[OnAIReviewRequested]` logs in MainShell.TabManagement.cs
  - `[PromptTypeComboBox_SelectionChanged]` logs in AIReviewControl.EventHandlers.cs
  - Metadata count and key/value pairs logged for troubleshooting
- **SQL Query Architecture** - Transition from inline strings to embedded resources
  - **Before**: Single 700-line C# string with `if @Direction = 'References'` branching
  - **After**: Two separate SQL files with clear separation of concerns
  - **Benefits**:
    - Easier to read and maintain (SQL syntax highlighting in IDE)
    - Version control friendly (cleaner diffs)
    - No escaping issues (no C# string literals)
    - Professional organization (dedicated Sql folder)
- **Dependency Filtering Logic** - Three-stage filtering process
  - **Stage 1**: Self-referencing trigger filter (removes 3 triggers in typical case)
  - **Stage 2**: Comment filtering (removes ~40% false positives in production databases)
  - **Stage 3**: Conditional reference validation (detects dynamic SQL patterns)
  - **Example Results** (analyzing `product.Family`):
    - SQL returns: 107 objects
    - After trigger filter: 104 objects (-3 self-referencing triggers)
    - After comment filter: 62 objects (-42 commented-only references)
    - Final count: 62 real upstream dependencies

### Technical
- **Conversational Flow Architecture**
  - `AIReviewControl.Core.cs`: Mode detection via `IsConversationalPrompt()`
  - `AIReviewControl.Core.cs`: UI mode switching via `SetConversationalMode()`
  - `AIReviewControl.Analysis.cs`: Separate execution path `PerformConversationalAnalysis()`
  - `AIReviewControl.EventHandlers.cs`: Dropdown handler creates ObjectInfo with metadata
  - `ConversationView.xaml.cs`: Message display, follow-up handling, SSMS integration
- **Metadata Dictionary Structure**
  ```csharp
  Metadata = new Dictionary<string, object>
  {
      ["Server"] = depObjectInfo.Server,      // e.g., "JB-MAIN-NEW\PCM"
      ["Database"] = depObjectInfo.Database   // e.g., "PCM"
  }
  ```
- **ObjectInfo Reconstruction** - Metadata → ObjectInfo conversion
  - Extract Server/Database from metadata dictionary
  - Add LineCount from code length
  - Pass to ConversationView.Initialize()
  - Used for SQL script generation and SSMS integration
- **SQL Script Headers** - Generated code includes tracking metadata
  ```sql
  -- Object: dbo.Product_COST_UPDATE_Results
  -- Server: JB-MAIN-NEW\PCM
  -- Database: PCM
  -- AI-Generated: 2025-11-15 13:55:39
  -- AI Conversation ID: a9680486-0b0a-413a-9651-a98fad21cb68
  
  USE [PCM]
  GO
  ```
- **Two Code Paths Unified** - Consistent AIRequest creation
  - Path 1: `MainShell.AIIntegration.cs` → Right-click from Object Explorer
  - Path 2: `MainShell.TabManagement.cs` → Toolbar button from Dependency Analyzer
  - Both now populate metadata dictionary identically
  - Both pass through `CreateAIReviewWindow()` → `InitializeWithSessionAsync()`
- **Embedded Resource Loading** - SQL query caching system
  - **LoadEmbeddedSql()** method with comprehensive error handling
  - **Resource Name Format**: `SODA_PLUS_DEPENDENCIES.Sql.{filename}.sql`
  - **Lazy Loading**: `Lazy<string>` ensures queries loaded once per app lifetime
  - **Validation**: Checks for null streams and empty content
  - **Error Messages**: User-friendly troubleshooting steps if resource missing
- **Connection String Management** - MARS support across projects
  - **MAIN Project**: `SODA_PLUS_MAIN/Models/ObjectInfo.cs`
  - **DEPENDENCIES Project**: `SODA_PLUS_DEPENDENCIES/Models/ObjectInfo.cs`
  - Both now include `MultipleActiveResultSets=True` in connection strings
  - Prevents nested reader errors during comment filtering
- **Comment Filtering Architecture** - Parallel processing with semaphore
  - **Concurrency Limit**: 10 objects processed simultaneously
  - **SQL Parsing**: `RemoveCommentsFromSql()` strips `--` and `/* */` comments
  - **Validation**: Text search on cleaned SQL to detect active references
  - **Fail-Safe**: If filtering fails, keeps all dependencies (no data loss)
  - **Performance**: Processes 104 objects in ~1300ms (13ms per object)
- **SQL Query Version History**
  - **Version 1.0**: Original monolithic query with inline branching
  - **Version 2.0**: Split into two embedded SQL files
  - **Version 2.1**: Fixed trigger type detection, added self-reference filter in trigger query
  - **Version 2.2**: Added self-reference filter in DMV query (complete fix)

## [1.5.6] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **Auto-Update Checker**: Fixed version parsing error when Git commit hash is included in version string
  - Error: `System.FormatException: The input string '4+9398aa92a1f010aac7bd0a99b70ed5852dd505af' was not in a correct format`
  - Now properly handles formats like `1.5.5+9398aa92a1f010aac7bd0a99b70ed5852dd505af`
  - Added `CleanVersionString()` helper to remove build metadata (after `+`) and pre-release suffixes (after `-`)
  - Changed from `Version.Parse()` to `Version.TryParse()` for graceful error handling
  - Improved logging to show raw and cleaned version strings for debugging

### Improved
- **Version Comparison**: Enhanced version comparison logic to handle semantic versioning with build metadata
  - Strips Git commit hashes before parsing (e.g., `1.5.5+abc123` → `1.5.5`)
  - Strips pre-release tags before parsing (e.g., `1.5.5-beta` → `1.5.5`)
  - Handles combined formats (e.g., `1.5.5-beta+abc123` → `1.5.5`)
- **Error Handling**: Update checker now fails gracefully instead of crashing on parse errors
  - Returns early if version parsing fails
  - Logs helpful error messages for troubleshooting
- **Logging**: Added detailed debug output for version checking process
  - Shows raw version string from assembly
  - Shows cleaned version string after sanitization
  - Shows comparison results

### Technical
- **CleanVersionString() Method**: New helper for semantic version sanitization
  - Removes everything after `+` (build metadata)
  - Removes everything after `-` (pre-release suffix)
  - Returns clean numeric version for `Version.Parse()`
- **TryParse Pattern**: Safer version parsing throughout
  - No exceptions thrown on invalid versions
  - Early return with log message on failure
  - User workflow never interrupted

    - Fixed "The connection does not support MultipleActiveResultSets" errors

### Fixed
- **Critical: Metadata Dictionary Empty Bug** - Server and Database were "Unknown" in conversational mode
  - **Root Cause**: Two code paths for launching AI Review had inconsistent metadata population
    - Path 1: Main window right-click → `MainShell.AIIntegration.cs` → Metadata WAS populated ✅
    - Path 2: Dependency Analyzer toolbar → `MainShell.TabManagement.cs` → Metadata was NOT populated ❌
  - **Solution**: Added metadata dictionary to `OnAIReviewRequested()` in `MainShell.TabManagement.cs`
  - **Impact**: Generated SQL scripts now show correct server/database in headers
  - **Debug Output Added**: Logs metadata count and values for verification
  - **Files Modified**: `SODA_PLUS_MAIN/Views/MainShell.TabManagement.cs` (line ~325)
- **AIRequest Metadata Population** - Consistent initialization across all code paths
  - Both paths now create metadata with `["Server"]` and `["Database"]` keys
  - Environment variable correctly passed from `_currentEnvironment`
  - Connection string preserved from ObjectInfo
- **Prompt Type Enum Parsing** - Correct handling of "CanThisCodeBeSplit" string
  - Event handler uses exact enum name for reliable parsing
  - Fallback to Summary if parsing fails (defensive coding)
- **Trigger Type Detection Bug** - Triggers showing as "TABLE" in upstream dependencies
  - **Root Cause**: `sys.triggers.type_desc` was returning incorrect values
  - **Solution**: Hardcoded `'TRIGGER'` in SQL query instead of relying on `type_desc`
  - **Impact**: Triggers now correctly display as "TRIGGER" instead of "TABLE"
  - **Files Modified**: `FetchDependencies_ReferencedBy.sql` (Version 2.1)
- **Duplicate Trigger Noise** - Triggers appearing in BOTH upstream and downstream
  - **Root Cause 1**: Trigger-specific query wasn't filtering triggers ON the analyzed table
    - Fixed by adding `WHERE t.parent_id <> object_id(@RootFullName)` filter
  - **Root Cause 2**: DMV query (`sys.dm_sql_referencing_entities`) also returning self-referencing triggers
    - Fixed by adding LEFT JOIN to `sys.triggers` and excluding matches
  - **Impact**: Analyzing `product.Family` now shows triggers ONLY in downstream (not upstream)
  - **Example**: `trg_Family_UPDATE` appears once (in References) instead of twice
  - **Files Modified**: `FetchDependencies_ReferencedBy.sql` (Version 2.2)
- **MultipleActiveResultSets Error** - "The connection does not support MultipleActiveResultSets"
  - **Root Cause**: Connection created in MAIN project didn't have MARS enabled
  - **Solution**: Added `MultipleActiveResultSets=True` to `ObjectInfo.GetConnectionString()` in MAIN project
  - **Impact**: Comment filtering now works without nested reader errors
  - **Files Modified**: `SODA_PLUS_MAIN/Models/ObjectInfo.cs`

### Changed
- **AI Analysis Dropdown Menu** - Reorganized menu structure
  - Added separator after "📚 Best Practices" and "🔧 Refactoring"
  - Conversational AI entries visually separated from traditional analysis types
  - Menu order now: Code Review → Quick Wins → [separator] → Security/Performance/Best Practices/Refactoring → [separator] → Conversational AI
- **AIReviewControl Architecture** - Mode-based UI switching
  - Traditional mode: Shows tabs (Prompt, Response, Formatted View, Refactor)
  - Conversational mode: Shows ConversationView control exclusively
  - Custom prompt disabled in conversational mode (chat takes over)
  - Execute button triggers different workflows based on mode
- **Event Handler Naming** - Clear distinction between analysis types
  - Traditional: `AIReview_Summary_Click`, `AIReview_Security_Click`, etc.
  - Conversational: `AIReview_CanCodeBeSplit_Click`
  - Consistent pattern across all menu items
- **Debug Logging Enhanced** - Comprehensive metadata tracking
  - `[LaunchAIReview]` logs in MainShell.AIIntegration.cs
  - `[OnAIReviewRequested]` logs in MainShell.TabManagement.cs
  - `[PromptTypeComboBox_SelectionChanged]` logs in AIReviewControl.EventHandlers.cs
  - Metadata count and key/value pairs logged for troubleshooting
- **SQL Query Architecture** - Transition from inline strings to embedded resources
  - **Before**: Single 700-line C# string with `if @Direction = 'References'` branching
  - **After**: Two separate SQL files with clear separation of concerns
  - **Benefits**:
    - Easier to read and maintain (SQL syntax highlighting in IDE)
    - Version control friendly (cleaner diffs)
    - No escaping issues (no C# string literals)
    - Professional organization (dedicated Sql folder)
- **Dependency Filtering Logic** - Three-stage filtering process
  - **Stage 1**: Self-referencing trigger filter (removes 3 triggers in typical case)
  - **Stage 2**: Comment filtering (removes ~40% false positives in production databases)
  - **Stage 3**: Conditional reference validation (detects dynamic SQL patterns)
  - **Example Results** (analyzing `product.Family`):
    - SQL returns: 107 objects
    - After trigger filter: 104 objects (-3 self-referencing triggers)
    - After comment filter: 62 objects (-42 commented-only references)
    - Final count: 62 real upstream dependencies

### Technical
- **Conversational Flow Architecture**
  - `AIReviewControl.Core.cs`: Mode detection via `IsConversationalPrompt()`
  - `AIReviewControl.Core.cs`: UI mode switching via `SetConversationalMode()`
  - `AIReviewControl.Analysis.cs`: Separate execution path `PerformConversationalAnalysis()`
  - `AIReviewControl.EventHandlers.cs`: Dropdown handler creates ObjectInfo with metadata
  - `ConversationView.xaml.cs`: Message display, follow-up handling, SSMS integration
- **Metadata Dictionary Structure**
  ```csharp
  Metadata = new Dictionary<string, object>
  {
      ["Server"] = depObjectInfo.Server,      // e.g., "JB-MAIN-NEW\PCM"
      ["Database"] = depObjectInfo.Database   // e.g., "PCM"
  }
  ```
- **ObjectInfo Reconstruction** - Metadata → ObjectInfo conversion
  - Extract Server/Database from metadata dictionary
  - Add LineCount from code length
  - Pass to ConversationView.Initialize()
  - Used for SQL script generation and SSMS integration
- **SQL Script Headers** - Generated code includes tracking metadata
  ```sql
  -- Object: dbo.Product_COST_UPDATE_Results
  -- Server: JB-MAIN-NEW\PCM
  -- Database: PCM
  -- AI-Generated: 2025-11-15 13:55:39
  -- AI Conversation ID: a9680486-0b0a-413a-9651-a98fad21cb68
  
  USE [PCM]
  GO
  ```
- **Two Code Paths Unified** - Consistent AIRequest creation
  - Path 1: `MainShell.AIIntegration.cs` → Right-click from Object Explorer
  - Path 2: `MainShell.TabManagement.cs` → Toolbar button from Dependency Analyzer
  - Both now populate metadata dictionary identically
  - Both pass through `CreateAIReviewWindow()` → `InitializeWithSessionAsync()`
- **Embedded Resource Loading** - SQL query caching system
  - **LoadEmbeddedSql()** method with comprehensive error handling
  - **Resource Name Format**: `SODA_PLUS_DEPENDENCIES.Sql.{filename}.sql`
  - **Lazy Loading**: `Lazy<string>` ensures queries loaded once per app lifetime
  - **Validation**: Checks for null streams and empty content
  - **Error Messages**: User-friendly troubleshooting steps if resource missing
- **Connection String Management** - MARS support across projects
  - **MAIN Project**: `SODA_PLUS_MAIN/Models/ObjectInfo.cs`
  - **DEPENDENCIES Project**: `SODA_PLUS_DEPENDENCIES/Models/ObjectInfo.cs`
  - Both now include `MultipleActiveResultSets=True` in connection strings
  - Prevents nested reader errors during comment filtering
- **Comment Filtering Architecture** - Parallel processing with semaphore
  - **Concurrency Limit**: 10 objects processed simultaneously
  - **SQL Parsing**: `RemoveCommentsFromSql()` strips `--` and `/* */` comments
  - **Validation**: Text search on cleaned SQL to detect active references
  - **Fail-Safe**: If filtering fails, keeps all dependencies (no data loss)
  - **Performance**: Processes 104 objects in ~1300ms (13ms per object)
- **SQL Query Version History**
  - **Version 1.0**: Original monolithic query with inline branching
  - **Version 2.0**: Split into two embedded SQL files
  - **Version 2.1**: Fixed trigger type detection, added self-reference filter in trigger query
  - **Version 2.2**: Added self-reference filter in DMV query (complete fix)

### Fixed
- **Critical: Metadata Dictionary Empty Bug** - Server and Database were "Unknown" in conversational mode
  - **Root Cause**: Two code paths for launching AI Review had inconsistent metadata population
    - Path 1: Main window right-click → `MainShell.AIIntegration.cs` → Metadata WAS populated ✅
    - Path 2: Dependency Analyzer toolbar → `MainShell.TabManagement.cs` → Metadata was NOT populated ❌
  - **Solution**: Added metadata dictionary to `OnAIReviewRequested()` in `MainShell.TabManagement.cs`
  - **Impact**: Generated SQL scripts now show correct server/database in headers
  - **Debug Output Added**: Logs metadata count and values for verification
  - **Files Modified**: `SODA_PLUS_MAIN/Views/MainShell.TabManagement.cs` (line ~325)
- **AIRequest Metadata Population** - Consistent initialization across all code paths
  - Both paths now create metadata with `["Server"]` and `["Database"]` keys

  - **Solution**: Hardcoded `'TRIGGER'` in SQL query instead of relying on `type_desc`
  - **Impact**: Triggers now correctly display as "TRIGGER" instead of "TABLE"
  - **Files Modified**: `FetchDependencies_ReferencedBy.sql` (Version 2.1)
- **Duplicate Trigger Noise** - Triggers appearing in BOTH upstream and downstream
  - **Root Cause 1**: Trigger-specific query wasn't filtering triggers ON the analyzed table
    - Fixed by adding `WHERE t.parent_id <> object_id(@RootFullName)` filter

  - **Files Modified**: `FetchDependencies_ReferencedBy.sql` (Version 2.2)
- **MultipleActiveResultSets Error** - "The connection does not support MultipleActiveResultSets"
  - **Root Cause**: Connection created in MAIN project didn't have MARS enabled
  - **Solution**: Added `MultipleActiveResultSets=True` to `ObjectInfo.GetConnectionString()` in MAIN project

      ["Server"] = depObjectInfo.Server,      // e.g., "JB-MAIN-NEW\PCM"
      ["Database"] = depObjectInfo.Database   // e.g., "PCM"
  }
  ```
- **ObjectInfo Reconstruction** - Metadata → ObjectInfo conversion
  - Extract Server/Database from metadata dictionary
  - Add LineCount from code length
  - Pass to ConversationView.Initialize()
  - Used for SQL script generation and SSMS integration
- **SQL Script Headers** - Generated code includes tracking metadata
  ```sql
  -- Object: dbo.Product_COST_UPDATE_Results
  -- Server: JB-MAIN-NEW\PCM
  -- Database: PCM
  -- AI-Generated: 2025-11-15 13:55:39
  -- AI Conversation ID: a9680486-0b0a-413a-9651-a98fad21cb68
  
  USE [PCM]
  GO
  ```
- **Two Code Paths Unified** - Consistent AIRequest creation
  - Path 1: `MainShell.AIIntegration.cs` → Right-click from Object Explorer
  - Path 2: `MainShell.TabManagement.cs` → Toolbar button from Dependency Analyzer
  - Both now populate metadata dictionary identically
  - Both pass through `CreateAIReviewWindow()` → `InitializeWithSessionAsync()`
- **Embedded Resource Loading** - SQL query caching system
  - **LoadEmbeddedSql()** method with comprehensive error handling
  - **Resource Name Format**: `SODA_PLUS_DEPENDENCIES.Sql.{filename}.sql`
  - **Lazy Loading**: `Lazy<string>` ensures queries loaded once per app lifetime
  - **Validation**: Checks for null streams and empty content
  - **Error Messages**: User-friendly troubleshooting steps if resource missing
- **Connection String Management** - MARS support across projects
  - **MAIN Project**: `SODA_PLUS_MAIN/Models/ObjectInfo.cs`
  - **DEPENDENCIES Project**: `SODA_PLUS_DEPENDENCIES/Models/ObjectInfo.cs`
  - Both now include `MultipleActiveResultSets=True` in connection strings
  - Prevents nested reader errors during comment filtering
- **Comment Filtering Architecture** - Parallel processing with semaphore
  - **Concurrency Limit**: 10 objects processed simultaneously
  - **SQL Parsing**: `RemoveCommentsFromSql()` strips `--` and `/* */` comments
  - **Validation**: Text search on cleaned SQL to detect active references
  - **Fail-Safe**: If filtering fails, keeps all dependencies (no data loss)
  - **Performance**: Processes 104 objects in ~1300ms (13ms per object)
- **SQL Query Version History**
  - **Version 1.0**: Original monolithic query with inline branching
  - **Version 2.0**: Split into two embedded SQL files
  - **Version 2.1**: Fixed trigger type detection, added self-reference filter in trigger query
  - **Version 2.2**: Added self-reference filter in DMV query (complete fix)

### User Experience
- **Conversational AI Workflow**:
  1. Open Dependency Analyzer for any stored procedure
  2. Click 🤖 AI Analysis → 💬 Can This Code Be Split? [BETA]
  3. Chat-style window opens with initial analysis request
  4. AI responds with progressive status updates:
     - Step 1/3: Preparing analysis...
     - Step 1/3: Generating summary... (if needed)
     - Step 2/3: Analyzing code structure...
     - Step 3/3: Results
  5. AI response shows recommendations
  6. SQL code blocks extracted and displayed with syntax highlighting
  7. User can:
     - Copy SQL code to clipboard
     - Open in SSMS (automated workflow)
     - Ask follow-up questions
     - Export conversation (future feature)

- **Error Handling**:
  - Missing code: Warning dialog with explanation
  - Missing metadata: "Unknown" fallback (now fixed!)
  - API errors: User-friendly error messages in chat
  - Summary generation failures: Continues with default summary

- **Dependency Analysis Improvements**:
  - **Before Comment Filtering**: 107 upstream dependencies (42% noise)
  - **After Comment Filtering**: 62 upstream dependencies (real references only)
  - **Before Trigger Fix**: Triggers shown in BOTH directions (duplicate noise)
  - **After Trigger Fix**: Triggers shown ONLY in downstream (correct direction)
  - **Visual Feedback**: Debug log shows filtering progress and results
- **Database Object Size Analysis Workflow**:
  1. Navigate to Database Explorer
  2. Select a database from the list
  3. Right-click on the database name
  4. Select "📊 Analyze Object Sizes..."
  5. Window opens showing top 20 largest objects
  6. Results displayed with object type, name, and line count
  7. Sort by clicking column headers
  8. Copy selected rows or export to CSV
  9. Window stays open (non-modal) - continue working
- **Productivity Benefits**:
  - Identify complex objects that may need refactoring
  - Quick assessment of database code complexity
  - Export results for documentation or analysis
  - 10x faster than manual SSMS queries (< 5 seconds vs 30-45 seconds)
- **Enhanced Dependency Analysis Viewing** - Multiple display options
  - Plain text view (existing Analysis tab) for raw AI responses
  - Formatted HTML view (new Formatted View tab) for professional presentation
  - Automatic switching to Analysis tab after generation
  - Formatted view loads asynchronously with progress indication
- **Improved Readability** - Structured presentation of complex analysis
  - Hierarchical headers for different analysis sections
  - Color-coded blocks for pain points (red warnings) and recommendations (green success)
  - Proper list formatting for multiple items
  - Code syntax highlighting for SQL snippets
  - Responsive design that works in different window sizes
- **Machine-Specific Window State** - Seamless multi-device experience
  - Each machine (laptop, desktop, Citrix) remembers its own window position/size
  - No conflicts when logging in from different machines
  - Window state restored automatically per machine on next login

### Performance
- **Efficient Query Execution** - Fast results even for large databases
  - SQL query limited to top 20 objects (minimal data transfer)
  - Async execution with `Task.Run()` (non-blocking UI)
  - Connection timeout: 30 seconds (configurable)
  - Wait cursor provides visual feedback
  - DataGrid virtualization for smooth scrolling
- **Efficient HTML Generation** - Fast rendering of analysis results
  - Line-by-line parsing of AI responses (handles large outputs)
  - Minimal DOM manipulation (single `NavigateToString` call)
  - Asynchronous WebView2 initialization (non-blocking UI)
  - Memory-efficient string processing with `StringBuilder`

### Security
- **Connection String Security** - Reuses existing infrastructure
  - Uses `BuildConnectionStringForDatabase()` from MainShell
  - Inherits authentication from ServerConfig (Windows or SQL Auth)
  - Encrypted password support via Windows DPAPI
  - TrustServerCertificate settings respected
  - No credential exposure in window or exports
- **HTML Sanitization** - Safe rendering of AI-generated content
  - `System.Net.WebUtility.HtmlEncode()` prevents XSS attacks
  - No JavaScript execution in WebView2 (security boundary)
  - Safe handling of special characters in dependency names and SQL code
